A command line toolkit for working with the [Feedbin HTTP
API](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin-api/)

Right now we are focused on only reading (GET) from the Feedbin API
for information retrieval, backup, collection, and analysis
purposes. The cli is not intended to be a full fledged Feedbin
client. If motivated, the mutating methods (PUT, POST) may be
implemented in the future.

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`. Even better use
[`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) which should work perfectly
fine with the URL below:

    pip install git+https://github.com/crossjam/feedbin-tools.git

## Usage

For help, run:

    feedbin-tools --help

You can also use:

    python -m feedbin_tools --help


<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from feedbin_tools import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.cli, ["--help"])
help = result.output.replace("Usage: cli", "Usage: feedbin-tools")
cog.out(
    "```\n{}\n```".format(help)
)
]]] -->
```

## Development

To develop this module further, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

	git clone +https://github.com/crossjam/feedbin-tools.git
	cd feedbin-tools
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

To run the tests:

    pytest
	
This is a hobby, side (very side) project. Iâ€™m grateful for PR
submissions and filed issues, but responses might lag by quite a bit.
